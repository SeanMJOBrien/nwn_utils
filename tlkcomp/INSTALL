Installing nwntlkcomp

The release includes a 32bit lunix binary compiled against glibc6. This 
may work on your Linux system. If so you can just copy nwntlkcomp to 
somewhere in your path (/usr/local/bin or ~/bin/ for example).

If this does not run you can build it yourself. Make sure you have the 
development libraries and tools installed. The tool only requires glibc, 
it does not use other libraries. You also need the make utility.

On a 64bit system you will need to install the 32it gcc and glibc development
packages since the makefile tries to build a 32 bit version by default.
If you want to build a native 64bit version simply comment out the line
   ARCH=-m32  
in makefile. 

To compile just run make.  And then copy the resulting binary as above.

There are a few tls files included in tests/  which can be used for 
validation. 

cd tests
#convert the cep tls file to a tlk
../nwntlkcomp -o t.tlk cep23_v1.tls
#convert it back to tls 
../nwntlkcomp -o t.tls t.tlk
# compare to make sure they are the same
diff t.tls cep23_v1.tls
# should be no output here...
