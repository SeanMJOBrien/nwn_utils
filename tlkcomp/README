This program is releases under the GPL v2.0


This program is used to translate uncompiled talk table files (called tls 
files and using the .tls extension) to and from Bioware's TLK 
file format as used in NWN 1 (.tlk extension). It can also be used to 
output the same format as the input which is useful for testing and
to update the user entries in the tls format file. 

The purpose is to store the tlk file in a text format for easy versioning
and editting. It can also be used with spellchecking and grep and other
text based tools. 

The TLK format is defined in Bioware_Aurora_TalkTable_Format.pdf. 
It is a binary format with fixed length headers for each entry followed by 
free-form data for each string. 

The TLS format is specific to this program. A TLS file starts with a header 
line which must be  "#TLS V1.0 Uncompiled TLK source#" (no quotes and with 
a newline directly following the last #. The header is followed buy the 
non-empty text entries. Only the non-empty ones are needed.

Each entry is two integers surrounded by <> and a colon, followed by text.

<0><0>:Bad Strref
<2><0>:This is line 2

The first number is the entry number in this file. Each must be unique and 
they should be in order. They do not have to be consecutive. The second
number is the value as used in 2da files and scripts to reference that line.
In user TLK files that is 16,777,216 + line number. In the main dialog.tlk file
that is the same as the line number.  This may be left as 0 in tls files. 
when a tls file is written out the compiler will fix these numbers. So when 
adding new lines it is not necessary to manually enter them. Just set to zero 
and run the compiler on the file.  The second number is purely a helper for 
the user. It has no effect on the resulting TLK file.

Multiple line text is allowed and is done simply by having the following lines
begin on the lines following the entry:

<4><0>:this is a mult-line
tlk entry with newlines and "quotes"
<5><0>:This is entry 5

When creating a TLK file from tls input the TLK file is automatically padded
to fill in any gaps in the entry nubmers.

Usage: 
       nwntlkcomp [-dnv] [-i <fmt>] [-f <fmt] -o <outfile> <infile>
       
       Where outfile is named with an appropriate extension. Infile 
       type will be detected if possible.

       -i <fmt> : specify the format of the input file ("tlk" or "tls")
             Will error if file is not of specificied format.

       -f <fmt> : specify the format of the output file ("tlk" or "tls")
             Will produce output file in given format regardless of 
	     outfile's extension.

	-n: Do not use high numbers for translating the user entry number.
	This produces <1><1>: entry instead of <1><16,777,217:entry. This is 
	useful for decompiling dialog.tlk.

	-v: enable a bit mor everbose output, number of entries etc.

	-d: enable debug output, lots of data you probably don't care about.
