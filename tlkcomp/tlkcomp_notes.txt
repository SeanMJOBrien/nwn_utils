Goal - read tlk files and decompile to a text file.
       reat decompiled file and compile to tlk file

       text file contains line number and real line number and text.

       1;16777217;this is strref 1
       2;16777218;"this is 
                       strref 2"
       100;16777316;"this is strref 100"
       ...

What language should this be done in? See about reading and writing the files.
There's no GFF info here. TLK files are different.

Perl? Pattern matching, can start lines easily enough. 

Maybe just use C?  The foramt is a little complicated. Theres a multibyte header for each entry.
This has a flag with bit 0 set to say the text is present and an offset into the base data. 

These headers are fixed size though.
