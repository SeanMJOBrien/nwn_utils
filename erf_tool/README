Neverwinter Nights ERF Utility
Version: 1.2

Copyright (C) 2003, Gareth Hughes <roboius@dladventures.net>

Additions and fixes by meaglyn <meaglyn.nwn@gmail.com>  Copyright 2014.

The updated version has not been built or tested on windows. It supports
linux only (possibly other Unix variants). 

To build: 
   Ensure you have gcc and basic c development packages installed.

   	  cd src
   	  make

    Resulting binary is erf-1.2/src/erf. The update.sh script will
    find it there if you leave it in place.


Changes: 
	 Add support for quoted input file names to handle spaces.
	 Fix compile issues.

The Neverwinter Nights Encapsulated Resource Format (ERF) Utility 'erf'
is a command line tool that acts very much like the standard UNIX 'tar'
command, and even shares many of the same command line options.  It
interacts with the various NWN ERF files, such as ERF (.erf), HAK
(.hak), module (.mod and .nwm) and saved game (.sav) files.

Currently, 'erf' can create, extract and list the contents of ERF
files.  Future versions will be able to merge/update files and ERFs into
existing ERFs, just like you can do in the toolset but without all the
overhead that comes with it.

For information on exactly how to use 'erf', just run 'erf --help' from
the command line.

This utility works very well when combined with other command line
tools for Neverwinter Nights, such as Torlack's MDL and script
compilers.  These are available at http://www.torlack.com, and I highly
recommend them.  I use 'erf' in conjunction with Torlack's script
compiler to create and edit scripts using Emacs, bash and GNU make.  A
simple Makefile will allow you to compile your scripts and build a HAK
out of them.  Future versions of 'erf' will allow you to merge files or
ERFs into pre-existing ERFs, such as a HAK or game module.

Why did I create this utility?  Because I really hate the script editor
in the NWN toolset, and I'm a UNIX hacker -- I like editing in Emacs, I
like typing 'make install' in a shell, and so on.

Changes in version 1.1
======================

  - Add basic merge support (individual files only, no ERFs).
  - Better error checking in various places.

Changes in version 1.0.2
========================

  - Renamed error() to fatal_error() to better reflect what this
    function is used for.
  - Use fputs() instead of printf() for constant strings.
  - Made compare_resources() a static function.
  - Fix command line argument wildcards on Windows by linking with
    'setargv.obj'.
  - General restructuring to support ERF merging, coming soon.
  - Output more information to stderr, particularly when files are
    skipped.

Changes in version 1.0.1
========================

  - Added README file.
